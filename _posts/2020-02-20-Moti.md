title: "Using persuasive design for the better: a motivational app."
---

Do you like doing... *stuff*? This application should be perfect for you! At least, once it will be released...

# Introduction

This is a short, quick and informal analysis of a simple application that I developed during the attendance of the *Mobile Programming and Multimedia* course, given in the [University of Padua](http://informatica.math.unipd.it/laureamagistrale/mobileprogrammingemultimediaen.html).

# Motivations

What is **persuasive technology**?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persuasive_technology) reports a brief definition, defined by [B. J. Fogg](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/764008.763957):

> **Persuasive technology** is broadly defined as technology that is designed to change attitudes or behaviors of the users through persuasion and social influence, but not through coercion.

This novel field of study exploits the natural human behavior to lead a user to perform a desired action. For example, why do we keep scrolling the Facebook homepage? Social scientists study many techniques in order to dissuade a user to perform an action.

This is **not** inherently good or bad: we could use these tricks to realize a powerful and intuitive UI for an application, designing an interface that is accessible for the greatest number of users.

This type of sciences can be, sadly, used with other intentions in mind: [PolyMatter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgNg3vwj3xt7QOrcIDaHdFg), a YouTube channel about technology and economics, produced a wonderful video on this topic. This video reports how the current mobile gaming market uses those techniques to merely increase revenue.

## Moti

What are some positive applications of these techniques?

This app wants to answer this specific question: *Moti* is a mobile app that implements a simple tool to enable the user to plan his **personal objectives**, by assisting the user in the creation of a good subdivision and leading him by exploiting *gamification* and *persuasive design* techniques, in order to complete the objective desired.

The added value of the app is represented by the implementation of the [Fogg Behavior Model](https://www.behaviormodel.org/) and the [Fogg Behavior Grid](https://www.behaviorgrid.org/): the application is able to identify the best strategy to use, based on the specific characteristics of the objective and of the user.

# Showcase

## Landing page

It is essential that the user **understands** what is the app **scope**:
* The first screen explains **why** the user should use the app.
* The second screen explain **how** the app is going to increase the user motivation.
* The third screen introduces the tutorial. A tutorial is immensively useful to increase user retention and can be used to give the user a new, pleasing experience.

The user is introduced to the elements of the main interface, following a learning-by-example approach. The main focus here is to explain the difference between **Objective** and **Tasks**: this was a crucial point that was found to be hard to convey to the testers. The usage of a real example ("Exercise"/"Run") was crucial, since it is a known activity.

Since now, the user was given a predetermined path and he couldn't pick any other action (except for skipping the tutorial); offering multiple choices helps in **engaging the user** and to **increase its motivation** in reaching the objective proposed.

## Tutorial

The user receives supporting elements to help him to complete the activities proposed:
* The first *task card* is moving to suggest the action taught to the user before.
* A *notification dot* is used to remind the user to give attention to the element.

The user gets an achievement: this is useful to **reward** the user for accomplishing this activity.

The user is suggested to pull an element below with a bouncing animation. The action required to the user is intuitive, similar to the extraction of a piece of paper.

The action to be performed was designed to be the most **usable** and **pleasurable** feature of the application, since adding new tasks is instrumental to the long-term usage of the app.

The keyboard pops out immediately to let the user to input data with the least amount of actions. This is essential: the user must not be obstructed in adding new tasks.

The app proposes also some new tasks to be added and tries to give more detailed suggestions based on the user input. Here, intelligent systems such as a [recommender system] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) would shine: imagine users sharing tutorials, recipes, exercises between each other; or users receiving suggestions as tasks to be added based on the experience of other users.

This could lead to the creation of a **social network** specifically aimed to share and accomplish personal goals.

At the end the user is rewarded for his actions and can complete a new achievement.

Some popular apps were crucial to the development of Moti.

## Reflectly

| Element                  | Description                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Name                     | [Reflectly](https://reflectly.app/) |
| Installation (June 2019) | 1 500 000+                          |
| Model                    | Freemium, with premium subscription |
| Average score            | 4.1 (Android), 4.5 (iOS)            |

The application is mainly a personal diary used to reflect on the daily activities of the user. It uses artificial intelligence to help the user to overcome negative thoughts and to educate him to the best psychological practices to face his issues. The techniques implemented are based on *positive psychology* and *cognitive behavioral therapy* (CBT).

## Daylio

| Element                  | Description                          |

| Installation (June 2019) | 1 000 000+                           |
| Model                    | Freemium, with single purchase       |
| Average score            | 4.8 (Android), 4.8 (iOS)             |

The app is similar to Reflectly, although with a simpler and cleaner interface. Its structure enables the user to have a keyboard-free interaction, making the creation of a personal diary faster and less demanding.

# Conclusions

You made it this far? Awesome! 😎

I hope to update with some other blog posts some other aspects of the app, in particular the Fogg Behavior Model implemented in Moti or some ideas to create a smarter application.
