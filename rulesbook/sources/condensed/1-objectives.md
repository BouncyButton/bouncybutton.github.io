# Objectives

In the following introduction, we want to provide:

1. Some definitions used in **rule learning** 
2. Give a **proposed taxonomy** of works in the field
3. Show the **main concepts** behind the most popular works.

## Outline

1. What is rule learning?
2. Why should we care about rule learning?
3. How do we learn a new rule?
4. How do we evaluate rules?
5. How do we compose rules?
6. How do we optimize rule-based models?

## Main concepts

1. **Rules**: Broadly speaking, a rule defines **relationships**.
2. **Rule-based model**: Rules are combined into a **model** to perform a task, e.g., classification.
3. **Backpropagation vs. combinatorial optimization**: pros and cons for two learning approaches.
