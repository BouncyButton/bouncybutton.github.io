# Why rule learning?

Let's state why rule learning is important.

## Rules are an understandable representation of knowledge

They are easy to interpret and can be used to explain the reasoning behind a decision. This is especially important in domains where **interpretability** is crucial, such as healthcare, finance, and law.

## Rules can be a common language to encode knowledge

Rules are not only useful to infer knowledge from data but also to encode knowledge from experts. This is important in domains where **expert** knowledge is known.

## Rules can simplify optimization

Rules can provide a language to reduce the space of possible models by excluding impossible outcomes.
