# Heuristic search for deep rule-based models

Few works have attempted to generalize combinatorial optimization to find deep rule-based models, with decision trees being a notable exception (but with not much focus on rule learning). The main issue is the much wider search space of the model, which makes it harder to find a good solution, thus heuristics are needed.
