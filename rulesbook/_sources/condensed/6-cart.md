# CART

A decision tree can be seen as a rule-based model, where each node represents a rule, and it is combined with other rules in a tree-like structure. In rule learning, it is usually used as baseline to benchmark rule-based models.

## TL;DR

* **Pros:**
  * Mature and widely used.
  * Can still be interpreted
  * More scalable
* **Cons:**
  * Very prone to overfitting if not pruned.
  * Not as interpretable as other rule-based models
