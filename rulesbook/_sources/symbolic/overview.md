# Learning rules in a symbolic way

Learning rules in a symbolic, (or programmatic?) way has been the initial approach for rule learning. It usually comprises the following steps:

1. Define appropriate binary features.
2. Mine appropriate rules from data.
3. Evaluate the quality of a rule.
4. Prune and/or generalize a rule.
